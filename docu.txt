In this document, all findings regarding to the reverse engineering of the serial protocol for the 
FY6800 will be documented.

WAVEFORM LIST:

	0 : sine 
	1: square
	2: cmos
	3: adj-pulse	Note: Requires second parameter WMSXX, maxval:4000000000 minval:10
	4: dc 			Note: Requires second parameter WMP, 
	5: triangle
	6: ramp
	7: neg-ramp
	8: stair-trgl
	9: stair-step
	10: neg-stair
	11: pos-exp
	12: neg-exp
	13: pos-fall-exp
	14: neg-fall-exp
	15: pos-log
	16: neg-log
	17: pos-fall-log
	18: neg-fall-log
	19: pos-full-wave
	20: neg-full-wave
	21: pos-half-wave
	22: neg-half-wave
	23: lorenz-pulse
	24: multitone (what tones are used ???)
	25: rand-noise (does the frequency parameter change anything here?)
	26: ECG
	27: trapezoid
	28: sinc-puls
	29: impulse
	30: AWGN (what does this mean ???)
	31: AM (amplitude modulated)
	32: FM (freq-mod)
	33: chirp (wtf is this???)
	34: EMPTY
	35: EMPTY
	
	GOES ON UNTIL 97 


CREATING CUSTOM WAVEFORMS:

	DDS_WAVE64  (DDS_WAVE_XX where XX are the wave indexes)
	Then:
		- 8192 samples 
		- 16 bits/sample
		- max value = FF 3F
		- min value = 00 00
		- center value = 8F FF ???
		- the LSB goes first (so the value is 3F FF)


MODULATIONS:


SWEEPS: (BETTER DONE IN SOFTWARE, I THINK GIVES MORE CONTROL)

SOB0: Chooses frequency sweep.
SOB1: Amplitude sweep. 
SOB2: Offset sweep. 
SOB3: Duty Cycle sweep. 	

SXY1: 


MEASURE:

GATE 1S:		WCG0	// don't really know what the hell does this mean.						
GATE 10S:		WCG1
GATE 100S:		WCG2


OTHER OPTIONS:

UBZ1: ENABLES BUZZER 
UBZ0: DISABLES BUZZER 	
UMS0: UPLINK MASTER  	// when the hell am I using this uplink?
UMS1: UPLINK SLAVE		// get the user manual to check what's this uplink. 
UUL0: UPLINK ON
UUL1: UPLINK OFF 		// still what the hell is this uplink ??
